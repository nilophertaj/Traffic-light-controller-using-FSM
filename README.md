# Traffic-light-controller-using-FSM
This project implements a traffic light controller using Verilog RTL based on a finite state machine (FSM) design. It controls signal transitions between red, yellow, and green lights efficiently. The design is suitable for FPGA simulation and demonstrates core digital logic and sequential design principles in hardware description languages.
